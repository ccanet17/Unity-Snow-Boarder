# Unity Snow Boarder

A 2D snowboarding game where the player navigates a snowy slope and must reach the finish without crashing.

---

## 🛠 Unity Version
Built with **Unity 2022.3.4f1 (LTS)**

---

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

The player controls a snowboarder traveling down a snowy course. The objective is to maintain balance, avoid crashing into obstacles, and successfully reach the end goal.

The gameplay emphasizes physics-driven movement and rotational control.

## 📚 What I Learned

Through this project, I gained practical experience with:

- Applying torque using `Rigidbody2D`
- Managing physics-based rotational movement  
- Handling collision events to control game states  
- Implementing scene reload logic after failure  
- Understanding how terrain design influences physics behavior  

This project reinforced my understanding of Unity’s 2D physics system and strengthened my ability to build movement mechanics driven by real-time physics interactions.
